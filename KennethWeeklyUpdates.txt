My subsystem board is assembled right now, and I can upload code to the mcu chip. However, I do not see a response from the mcu via the serial port. I do not know if this is a programming issue or a hardware issue.

My plan for the future is to identify the source of the issue and then coding the mcu logic for processing sensor data and controlling power.

I have verified I can upload code to the mcu module and recieve feedback from the serial monitor in the arduino IDE. I have improved my routing on my schematic, and I am currently researching parts to use for testing connections between subsystems.

My plan for the future is to code the rest of the mcu logic and code for communication with the pc application.

2/1/24
My schematic and routing are now completely updated to interact with my teammates' updated subsystems. I am having some trouble communicating between the board and PC application due to inexperience with Ethernet using C++, but am not completely stuck.
My plan for the future is to fix the bugs with the TCP protocol and finish code for I2C and SPI in the MCU logic for sensor connections.

2/8/24
More updates to schematic and routing to sync with teammate subsystems. Continued to work on TCP/IP protocol code. Rudimentary MCU I2C and SPI code done. Will disscuss I2C and SPI code for peripherals with teammates. Will try to get working TCP/IP code done.

2/15/24
Updates to schematic, rerouted entire PCB to better fit specifications. Discussed connections and integration specs with teammates/TA, will continue to work on integration.

2/22/24
Integration PCB created. All three subsystems combined in schematics. All three subsystems present on PCB, figuring out split planes and nets with connecting subystems. Will continue to work on integration.

2/29/24
Most connections on PCB are routed, currently fixing minor issues. Plan to send files to TI for review by friday. Will edit integration based on feedback from TI.

3/7/24
PCB sent off for review by TI, made preliminary changes based on TI feedback.

3/21/24
TI review has not come in yet, plan on assembling PCB by next meeting.

3/28/24
The board was heavily delayed due to factors outside of our control, so the only progress we have is that we ordered and recieved our parts. We plan on assembling and testing by next meeting.

4/4/24
Board has arrived, my subsystem parts are fully soldered with a few shorts to fix. Stanley's subsystem is also done, only Aaron's left. Plan on finishing assembly and testing.
