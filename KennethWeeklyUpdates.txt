My subsystem board is assembled right now, and I can upload code to the mcu chip. However, I do not see a response from the mcu via the serial port. I do not know if this is a programming issue or a hardware issue.

My plan for the future is to identify the source of the issue and then coding the mcu logic for processing sensor data and controlling power.
